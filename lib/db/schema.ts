 * renames fields and we'd rather keep older snapshots parseable than blow up
 * on schema drift. `top_legend_id` is the player's most-played legend in this
 * ranked season — pre-computed so the leaderboard join stays cheap.

 * Lifetime stats (from /player/{id}/stats) will land in a sibling column /
 * table once player profile pages need them.
